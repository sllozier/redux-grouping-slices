<h5 align="center">Grouping data inside of a state within one slice can be helpful</h5>

## Main Idea

Let's just say you have a learning web application where you would like to have:

1. Initial Guest View

2. Teacher Portal

3. Student Portal

And you would like to treat these as if they were separate web applications within a larger one. This can be helpful when working with multiple people in multiple branches and a short deadline. It is helpful to give each their own Redux Slice and be able to pull state for all of the Teacher's students by having a studentsList state set inside of that Teacher slice. You will see this demonstrated in this repo.
